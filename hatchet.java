/**
 * Brian Robeson is travelling to visit his father, who is divorced and lives away from his 
 * mother. Robeson is on a plane ride alone with only the pilot flying the plane. Suddenly 
 * the pilot has a heart attack and Brian presumes he is dead. Now the 13 year old is left to 
 * fly the plane on his own. Of course, as if things could not get any worse, the engine stops
 * working. Now a 13 year old is basically trapped alone inside a crashing plane. Well, 
 * Brian somehow crash lands the plane in the water, get out barely harmed, and make it to 
 * shore before going unconscious. Soon he wakes up to find himself stranded alone in the 
 * wilderness. He spends months on his own adapting to the wilderness, fighting for his own 
 * survival each day. The RPG game will take you through his journey and put you in his shoes.
 * You will have to make some tough decisions. In a world where it is survival for the fittest,
 * how far will you proceed on your own?
 * Are you smart enough to survive just like Brian did?
